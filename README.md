# Project-Files
This is a collection of all our Arduino files. It contains files from projects such as CanSat, our car project, FireGuard and some standalone modules.
This is a collection of some random project files coded in C++ for some Arduino projects in school. It contains files for some testing with servos and even a self driving car.

## List of files and folders
1. FireDetection
   - A file which can detect fire using a heat sensor.
2. FireGuard folder
     - Has some small files for our first idea for FireGuard a system for automatic fire prevention. This was an early version and we didn't really make alot on this version.
3. MotorController-Rader
   - A more extended version of "MotorController" with built in radar (Ultra sound sensor) capability used to detect object distance. This file also has basic self driving.
5. MotorController
   - A file for controlling 4 motors with wheels for driving.
6. Servo Folder
   - Some random files used for playing around with servos one of which has a web interface that can be used to control the servo remotely.
7. alseT folder (Totally not Tesla backwards)
   - Some files for a self driving car.
8. Rader
   - A project involving a ultra sound sensor which is measuring distance and a screen which displays the distance.
